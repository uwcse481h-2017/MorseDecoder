People with mobility impairments may have difficulties with communication and operating electronic devices such as phones and computers. Fortunately, there are assistive technologies available to help people with mobility impairments effectively use technology.

Certain types of mobility impairments limit the types of actions that the user can execute. For example, individuals experiencing Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI) may "...require assistive technologies in order to use a computer without pain". Impairments such as RSI can prevent the use of standard input devices, such as a keyboard or mouse.

By utilizing a machine learning algorithm, Morse Decode provides an interface for mobility impaired users to communicate using Morse code input.
